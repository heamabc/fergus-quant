              The idea behind R squared and AIC is quite different. \(R^2\) tells us how well the model can 
              fit our data. AIC tells us how well the model will predict on new data.
              {String.raw`$$
              \text{AIC} = T\log\left(\frac{\text{SSE}}{T}\right) + 2(k+2)
              $$`}
              <PassageTitle label="Stepwise Regression" />
              <p>
              When given a lot of predictors, for example 40 predictors. There will be a combination of 
              \(2^{40} \) of models. How to choose the best model with suitable number of useful predictors?
              Stepwise regression can help us reduce the time to fine tune the model.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, we include all the predictors and evaluate the model using F-test, Adjust R Squared, 
                AIC, BIC, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then we remove the predictors one-by-one and evaluate each model. (Therefore, each model has 39 
                predictors.)
              </p>
              <p>
                We choose the model that statistically significantly improve the performance. Then repeat 
                the process.
